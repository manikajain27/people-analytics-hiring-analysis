## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze hiring funnel: applications → interviews → offers → hires  
- Measure time spent in each stage (e.g., screening, technical, HR)  
- Identify drop-off points and optimize stage-level efficiency  
- Support HR teams with visual insights for pipeline management

- **SQL** – Extracting stage-wise metrics and funnel conversion rates  
- **MS Excel** – Pivot tables and visual summaries  
- **Python (Pandas, Seaborn)** – EDA and stage-wise time calculations  
- *(Optional)* Power BI – Hiring pipeline dashboard

## 📊 Key Insights

- 42% of candidates dropped after technical interviews  
- Average time-to-hire: **21 days**, with **screening → interview** as the longest stage  
- Time reduction opportunities in coordination and feedback loops  
- Visual pipeline helped HR team focus on stage-specific bottlenecks

---

## 📂 Dataset
  
- Includes: candidate ID, application date, interview stages, status, offer dates, hire flag
